    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My wife's favorite! A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.</p>
    <p><strong>Prep:</strong> 15 mins<br>
    <strong>Cook:</strong> 1 hr<br>
    <strong>Total:</strong> 1hr 15 mins<br>
    <strong>Servings:</strong> 8</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices cooked ham</li>
      <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 7x11-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Pound chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Place 1 Swiss cheese slice and 1 ham slice on top of each breast. Roll up each breast, and secure with a toothpick. Place in the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle chicken evenly with bread crumbs.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven, and place 1/2 Swiss cheese slice on top of each breast. Return to the oven until cheese has melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove toothpicks and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
